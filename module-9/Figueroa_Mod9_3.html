    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <p>
        Achieving greatness is not about talent alone—it is about <span id="word1">_________</span>.  
        Those who push forward despite obstacles find themselves reaching new heights.  
        No challenge is too great when determination fuels the journey.  
    </p>

    <p>
        The road to mastery requires consistent <span id="word2">_________</span>.  
        Whether learning a new skill, perfecting a craft, or overcoming personal struggles,  
        small steps taken daily lead to remarkable progress over time.  
    </p>

    <p>
        When failure strikes, only <span id="word3">_________</span> can keep the dream alive.  
        True success is not measured by how many times we fall, but by how many times we rise again.  
        With patience and persistence, the ultimate reward—<span id="word4">_________</span>—is within reach.  
    </p>
