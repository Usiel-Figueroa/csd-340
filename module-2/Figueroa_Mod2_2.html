        <h2>Chapter 1: Usiel Figueroa Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Usiel Figueroa. I hope all of you are doing well. I do not have any nicknames. I love my name because of its meaning, "Strength of God," and uniqueness. My home is in California. Warner Springs, CA, to be exact, has excellent weather almost all year long.</p>

        <p>I am outdoorsy, enjoying traveling and exploring the great outdoors whenever possible. In addition, I stay active at the gym too. I'm currently working at Macy's selling Furniture. I have been there for almost 19 years. It is fun and keeps me busy.</p>

        <p>I am so excited to continue my education journey. I enrolled to complete CSD402 Java for Programmers and CSD 340 Web Development with HTML and CSS with you this Spring at Bellevue University. My major is Science and Technology, and I want to become a Software Developer. I plan to graduate with a bachelor's degree by the beginning of October 2025.</p>

        <p>I want to become a software developer to create apps, websites, and programs that can enhance people's entertainment, work, and lifestyles with the power of software technology—also developing new AI software in protection, labor, health, and science. I anticipate it will be demanding but rewarding. Because I don't have any significant experience, this course will provide the fundamental skills and knowledge to become a Software Developer.</p>

        <span class="sentence">I am excited to continue working with familiar classmates and our amazing professor Adam Bailey.</span>
